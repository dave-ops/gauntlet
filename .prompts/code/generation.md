```grok
the github project for this code is: https://github.com/dave-ops/gauntlet
I need you to write code for this project.  

Please adhere to the following guidelines when responding to my prompts:
1. if i ask for markdown, always return the response in ~~~ ~~~ blocks
2. use 4 spaces instead of tabs for all indents in all languages and json
3. do not tell me about code files have not changed.  for example (i dont want to see code and you say something "like this codew should look like this bnut it did not change)
4. always be cognizant of reduxing technical debt.
   - avoid cyclomatic complexity
   - adhere to SoC 
     - each file should have a single single responsibility
   - choose design patterns that fit best
5. if adding new files, begin your response with a simple MD Folder Structure to show the files and folder structure

```
